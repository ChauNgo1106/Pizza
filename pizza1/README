README for pizza1_setup
Hopefully all the directories and filenames you need show
up in this setup.  However the file contents need finishing.

Please make sure you can run the project on topcat, because
that's where the grader will run it.  See database.php for
code that lets you run on topcat. Be sure to load the pizza
database in your mysql account on topcat.

This project is set up to be installed at /cs637/username/pizza1
relative to the document root, where username is your topcat username.

Under Windows XAMPP, at \xampp\htdocs\cs637\username\pizza1
Under Mac OSX XAMPP, at /Applications/XAMPP/xampfiles/cs637/username/pizza1
Under Linux XAMPP, at /opt/lampp/cs637/username/pizza1

On topcat, at /var/www/html/cs637/username/pizza1
You have private access to this area using UNIX file permissions,
just as you have private access to your ~/cs637 directory area.

To be ready to run this project on topcat, you need to edit in your
topcat username in two places in these sources, as explained in
comments in these files:
1. in model/database.php
2. in view/header.php 
To run it with XAMPP, only the second one is needed, but the first
one doesn't hurt, so it is recommended to do both at once.

Once these edits are done, the project is set up to be deployed
at c:\xampp\htdocs\cs637\username\pizza1   for XAMPP on Windows
at /Application/XAMPP/htdocs/cs637/username/pizza1   for XAMPP on Mac
at /opt/lampp/htdocs/cs637/username/pizza1   for XAMPP on Linux
at /var/www/html/cs637/username/pizza1 for apache on topcat
where username is your topcat username.
