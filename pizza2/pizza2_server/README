README for pizza2_server

This project is set up to be installed at /cs637/username/pizza2_server
relative to the document root, where username is your topcat username.

On topcat, this project is meant to be installed at
/var/www/html/cs637/username/pizza2_server.
You have private access to this area using UNIX file permissions,
just as you have private access to your ~/cs637 directory area.

To be ready to run this project, you need to edit in your
topcat username in just one place in these sources, api/index.php,
as explained in a comment in that file.

You also need to make sure the pizza database is loaded--see
the files in the database directory.

Note that Netbeans will put a red exclamation point on the vendor directory
because one of its modules, called pimple, doesn't validate to Netbean's
satisfaction. That escalates to red marks on "Source Files" and the whole
project. Don't worry about these markings.
